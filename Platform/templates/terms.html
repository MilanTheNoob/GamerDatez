    <div class="card">
      <p>K, so this is how it will go, Imma split all these complicated nonsensical words into sections,
      with a healthy amount of gifs, jokes & sneaky rewards. At the end will be a TLDR bout what each section means
      and so on until we have covered everything.<br><br>
      Ready? No? Well screw you imma start anyway</p>
      <h2>Number 1 - Acceptance of Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>By creating a GamerDatez account or by trying to use the platform & its services in any capacity you agree
      to abide & be bound by the entirety of the Terms of Service and any terms described or disclosed to you if you
    access or purchase any additional features and/or services. If you do not or fail to accept the Terms of Service
    you should in no way be attempting to use our platform.<br><br>

    We may and likely will make changes & tweaks to this agreement and to the platform on a frequent basis,
    we will do this for a wide range of reasons including (but not limited to) changes to the law, the implementation
    of a new feature & changes in business practices. The latest & most relevant version will always be displayed here
    (https://www.[unkown as of yet]/terms) and also being the version that applies. It is your sole obligation to keep
    updated on changes to these terms. If changes include material changes to your rights or obligations you will be
    notified in advance with reasonable means. If you continue to use the platform and our services after the changes
    come into effect then you agree to the revised changes & implementation of the updated Terms of Service.
    You agree that this agreement shall supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and
    shall govern your entire relationship with GamerDatez, including (but not limited to) agreements, events & conduct
    preceding your acceptance to this agreement.<br><br>

    We ask that you carefully review the dispute resolution provisions below, these govern the manner in which claims
    will be addressed between you and GamerDatez. The provisions include a mandatory pre-arbitration informal dispute
    resolution process, an arbitration agreement, small claims court election, class action waiver, additional
    procedures for mass arbitration filings and jury trial waiver that affect your rights.<br><br>

    <b>TLDR;</b> You fully accept all our terms listed here and continued use of our platform after us making any
    changes to these terms means you accept the changes.Oh and if you have a dispute I will personally
    drown you in so much paperwork to avoid going to court since we ain't got time for that ðŸ™ƒ
    (plus why would you want to go to court with me ? :0 )
</p>
      <h2>NÃºmero 2 - Eligibility</h2>

      who is on a SDN list (less sorry now) then no entry for you (along with some more restrictions).
      And if you are under 18 then some rules will have to be in place for your safety.

      <h2>æ•°å­— 4 - Modifying the Service & Termination</h2>

      for any reason (without needing to be disclosed), upon such termination you will not be entitled for

      terminated.<br><br>

      <b>TLDR;</b>GamerDatez can update its service without telling you, and can close your account without
      warning ... damn that doesn't sound good without the legal jibber jabber ... ANYWAY look! fluffy dog</p>
