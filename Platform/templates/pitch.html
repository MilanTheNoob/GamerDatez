            Why sign up to GamerDatez? Well thats a great question I wished more people would ask. You see thats what
            this essay is for! So here is several hours of my life here to convince you to spend five minutes using
            this Tinder & Snapchat hybrid mixed with some humor from the office.

              <h1>A place dedicated to a single community</h1>
              <p>One that is completely dedicated to the incredibly gaming community and its members. A place
              that treats the community as its entire demographic, not a niche stepping stone to relegate as a sub-group
              down the line.</p>

              <p>And connecting with people over video games couldn't be more frictionless with more cheesy pickup
                lines than ever previously known! Where your both so busy focusing on what build palette to use in Minecraft

              the last penny out of their marketing budget we can up them with a $0 marketing budget with our
              ENTIRE platform full of dead trends from Twitter.<br><br>neat huh?</p>
