            Why sign up to GamerDatez? Well thats a great question I wished more people would ask. You see thats what
            this essay is for! So here is several hours of my life here to convince you to spend five minutes using
            this Tinder & Snapchat hybrid mixed with some humor from the office.

              Hello there! You must be new here, welcome to the archives.<br><br> 
              
              Here we have records of all moderate to major updates with a personal touch, each devlog describes the process of the update, whats new, what has been fixed, what bugs we have added and a summary of the state of the platform.<br><br>
              
              The logs will be short n sweet since they will be moderately frequent, the logs are also a good place to find potential ways to fix bugs if there isn't a solution in the FAQ or support is out fishing.<br><br>
              
              We do not actively show / promote when an update has been released but rather the content itself, the frequency of updates will be around every two to three weeks depending on size & interest.<br><br>
              
              Well thats all from me, make sure to like, subscribe, support me on Patreon and I will see you in the next one<br>

              <h3>Pre release #0</h3>
              <h4>The first hopefully historic release</h4>
              <p>Released 27 May 2022</p>
            </div>
            <h4>General Description</h4>
            <p>
              Thee first version of GamerDatez with a basic framework yet lacking all the features for release. Meant as a basic prototype to display ideas better rather than on google docs.<br><br>
              
              This release is more of a comparison marker for future versions rather than a proper release due to it not actually having any dating features lol.<br><br>
              
              Beware, here be dragons!
            </p>
            <h4>Changelog</h4>
            <p>
              - A barely working login & sign up system<br>
              - 50% finished terms of service<br>
              - Discord inspired 'pitch' webpage to do my smooth talking on potential users<br>
              - HTML template converted into a homepage<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Known Bugs / Problems</h4>
            <p>
              As much as it would shock you to hear the platform is <i>slightly</i> buggy.Here is a list of known bugs:<br><br>
              
              - Jittering when typing in a textarea<br>
              - Animation problems on the landing page<br>
              - Generally badly rendered gifs<br>
              - Jittering sidebars<br>
              - Very shocking error catching

              <h3>Patch #0.1</h3>
              <h4>Vanity time</h4>
              <p>Released 10 June 2022</p>
            </div>
            <h4>General Description</h4>
            <p>
              You know what a time consuming trip and infatuation of a new project combined equals? Depression about not making any progress.<br><br>
              
              This update is about trying to put the dating in a dating app, adding profile info, avatars, matching and more. Along with some extra side features & polishing. This is still more of a concept and a dump of ideas, templates & me trying to understand Django than an actual working Prototype.
            </p>
            <h4>Changelog</h4>
            <p>
              New features / major changes added to the platform:<br><br>
              
              - Setup after signup process where you input your information<br>
              - A crude concept Avatar system with placeholder images / resources<br>
              - Frontend HTML for the matching system<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Known Bugs / Problems</h4>
            <p>
              While some bugs have been fixed, more have been added due to a fair amount of time spent reorganising the backend, so here be glitches in the matrix: <br><br>
          
              - Font weighting problems on the landing page<br>
              - Submitting form data to the backend triggers a refresh<br>
              - Dodgy URL routing
              - CSS & styling inconcistencies<br>
              - All HTML & CSS responsiveness was dropped faster than the depreciation of a V12 car in 2022<br>
              - And holy crap that is a lot of warnings

          <h3>Something broke and it ain't working, what do I do?</h3>
          <p>
            We are a self sufficient community over here (or we pretend to be atleast). Follow these basic debugging steps to try and solve it:<br><br>
          
            - Find the problem on popular forums & social sites (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Discord, etc) and see if a solution presents itself<br>
          
            - Check the devlogs to see if the bug has been listed, if it has a fix & whats causing it<br>
          
            - Still ain't working? Damn, message me (deets in the about section) about it and I will do my best to include it in the next patch<br>
            - <b>Nuclear Option</b> - If it appears that the issue is frontend, install TamperMonkey and modify the website yourself

          <h3>Im bored</h3>
          <p>
            Bruhhh, why not use your time to help out your favourite dating app eh?<br>
            
            Sure as hell more entertaining to program or moderate while watching Netflix than just watching Netflix :D
          </p>
          <h3>A found a joke you made offensive to a minority ) group / me</h3>
          <p>
            GamerDatez is a unique platform that prides itself on being unique with its design & concept. This is highlighted by the content / jokes we use.<br>
            
            We take extensive care to in no way disrespect groups, historical events & identities but we will in no way take time out of development to modify / remove content that in no direct way harrases / disrespect one of the above.
            
            A famous stoic philosophy: <i>"It is not an external action / event that affects you but rather your response to it"</i>
          </p>
          <h3>I forgot my login!</h3>
          <p>To quote the landing webpage <i>"Well suck it, that isn't my problem"</i><br><br>
          
          Our reasoning for flat out not supporting alternate login methods is that this project & subsequently the code is in its infancy, and adding an easily exploitabpe feature without proper security measures & features (such as Two Factor Auth) it would be complete anarchy.
