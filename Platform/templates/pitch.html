            Why sign up to GamerDatez? Well thats a great question I wished more people would ask. You see thats what
            this essay is for! So here is several hours of my life here to convince you to spend five minutes using
            this Tinder & Snapchat hybrid mixed with some humor from the office.

              Hello there! You must be new here, welcome to the archives.<br><br> 
              
              Here we have records of all moderate to major updates with a personal touch, each devlog describes the process of the update, whats new, what has been fixed, what bugs we have added and a summary of the state of the platform.<br><br>
              
              The logs will be short n sweet since they will be moderately frequent, the logs are also a good place to find potential ways to fix bugs if there isn't a solution in the FAQ or support is out fishing.<br><br>
              
              We do not actively show / promote when an update has been released but rather the content itself, the frequency of updates will be around every two to three weeks depending on size & interest.<br><br>
              
              Well thats all from me, make sure to like, subscribe, support me on Patreon and I will see you in the next one<br>

          <h3>Something broke and it ain't working, what do I do?</h3>
          <p>
            Follow these basic debugging steps to try and solve it:<br><br>
          
            - Find the problem on popular forums & social sites (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Discord, etc) and see if a solution presents itself<br>
            - Check the devlogs to see if the bug has been listed, if it has a fix & whats causing it<br>
            - Still ain't working? Damn, message me (deets in the about section) about it and I will do my best to include it in the next patch<br>
            - <b>Nuclear Option For Nerds</b> - If it appears that the issue is frontend, install TamperMonkey and modify the website yourself

          <h3>Im bored</h3>
          <p>
            Why not use your time to help out your favourite dating app eh ðŸ˜‰<br>
            
            Sure as hell more entertaining to program or moderate while watching Netflix than just watching Netflix :D
          </p>
          <h3>I forgot my login!</h3>
          <p>To quote the landing webpage <i>"Well suck it, that isn't my problem"</i><br><br>
          
          Our reasoning for not supporting alternate login methods is that this project & subsequently the code is in its infancy, and adding an easily exploitable feature without proper security measures & features (such as Two Factor Auth) it would be complete anarchy.
